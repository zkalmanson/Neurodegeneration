# Neurodegeneration
Neurodegeneration Project.\
"ASC_NeuronCode_2021_v1_SurfKaze2" is a function that takes in an image, crops the image, tracks the dendrite, then detects blebbing. This is what we showed our collaborators\  
"NeurodegenScript" is a script that uses the function mentioned above, but allows use to use it for a folder of images, then labels the images with blebs and plots data\  
Currently working on using clustering to sort surfpoints, to see if this help with our goal of using nonbias thresholding. Will upload this file soon
