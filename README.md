# Neurodegeneration
Neurodegeneration Project.\
"blebDetection" is the most current version of detecting feature points\
"dendriteCropping" crops down images, still in progress of being cleaned up\
"createTrainingSet" and "TestingSet" are experiments with k means clustering to categorize points. These are still work in progress\










"ASC_NeuronCode_2021_v1_SurfKaze2" is a function that takes in an image, crops the image, tracks the dendrite, then detects blebbing. This is what we showed our collaborators\
"NeurodegenScript" is a script that uses the function mentioned above, but allows the user to use it for a folder of images, then labels the images with blebs and plots data\
"clusteringtest" is where I am experimenting with using kmeans clustering to sort surf points\
